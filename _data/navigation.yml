# Navigation configuration
# This file defines the navigation structure for the portfolio website
# It's used to generate the navigation menu in the sidebar and other navigation elements
#
# This file controls:
# 1. The main navigation links in the sidebar
# 2. The order of navigation items
# 3. The text and URLs for each navigation item
#
# To modify the navigation:
# - Add, remove, or reorder items in the 'main' list
# - Each item needs a title and url
# - Optionally add a target attribute for external links

# Main navigation items
# These appear in the sidebar and potentially other navigation areas
main:
  
  - title: About
    url: /about/
  
  - title: Projects
    url: /projects/
  
  - title: Writings
    url: /writings/
  
  - title: Journal
    url: /journal/
  
  - title: Contact
    url: /contact/

# You can add additional navigation sections as needed
# For example, a footer navigation or social links section
