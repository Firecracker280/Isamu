/*
main.scss
This is the main stylesheet that imports all the SASS partials and compiles them into a single CSS file.
Jekyll processes this file and outputs it as assets/css/main.css.

This file controls:
1. The order of SASS partial imports
2. Any global variables that need to be accessible to all partials
3. Any direct CSS that doesn't fit into the partials

To modify the styling:
- For base elements and resets: edit _sass/_base.scss
- For layout and page structure: edit _sass/_layout.scss
- For sidebar styling: edit _sass/_sidebar.scss
- For typography and text styling: edit _sass/_typography.scss
- For direct CSS that doesn't fit elsewhere: add it at the bottom of this file

// Import SASS partials
@import 
  "base",
  "typography",
  "layout",
  "sidebar"
;

// Any additional CSS that doesn't fit in the partials can be added here
// This is processed last and will override any previous styles

// Animation classes
.fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

.slide-in {
  animation: slideIn 0.5s ease-in-out;
