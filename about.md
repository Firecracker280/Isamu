      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>As art director and designer, I have been creating digital products and leading creative teams to connect design, technology & digital storytelling. I believe in technology and interaction as the key differentiator that can turn any product or campaign into a meaningful experience. I am inspired by algorithms, brazilian music and vintage motorcycles.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>Fuelled by an obsession of interaction systems, I aim to deliver thoughtful and challenging concepts through a process of research and development. This approach is influenced by a science background and an ability to work across multiple platforms, increasing the scope and potential of an idea. The possibilities of creating media through both technology and aesthetics are infinite.</p>
