## About Me

Fuelled by an obsession of interaction systems, I aim to deliver thoughtful and challenging concepts through a process of research and development. This approach is influenced by a science background and an ability to work across multiple platforms, increasing the scope and potential of an idea. The possibilities of creating media through both technology and aesthetics are infinite.

Through a process of *research, concept development & design*, I help build thoughtful interactive experiences for digital brands.

## Profile

As art director and designer, I have been creating digital products and leading creative teams to connect design, technology & digital storytelling. I believe in technology as a medium for creative expression and in design as a way to enhance human experiences.

My work spans across various domains including web design, user experience, interactive installations, and digital storytelling. I collaborate with brands and agencies to create meaningful digital experiences that engage and inspire.

## Approach

Fuelled by an obsession of interaction systems, I aim to deliver thoughtful and challenging concepts through a process of research and development. This approach is influenced by a science background and an ability to work across multiple platforms, increasing the scope and potential of an idea.

My design process typically involves:

1. **Research & Discovery** - Understanding the problem space, audience, and context
2. **Concept Development** - Exploring ideas and possibilities through sketching and prototyping
3. **Design & Refinement** - Crafting the visual and interactive elements of the experience
4. **Implementation & Testing** - Bringing the design to life and ensuring it works as intended
