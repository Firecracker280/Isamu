default.html
This is the main layout template that all pages will inherit from.
It defines the basic HTML structure and includes common elements like header, footer, and sidebar.
To use this layout, set "layout: default" in the front matter of your content files.

<html lang="en">
  {% include head.html %}
  <body class="{% if page.layout %}{{ page.layout }}{% endif %}{% if page.class %} {{ page.class }}{% endif %}">

    The sidebar contains navigation and site identity.
    It's positioned on the left side of the screen and is always visible on desktop.
    On mobile, it can be toggled with the menu button.

      <!-- 
      This is where the main content of each page will be inserted.
